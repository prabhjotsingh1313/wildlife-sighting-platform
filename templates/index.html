<h2>Report a Glider Sighting</h2>
<p>The Queensland Glider Network (QGN) was established in early 2006 to support glider populations by being a statewide hub for communication, education, data collection, mapping, and information exchange.</p>

<h3>Our Aims</h3>
<p>Australia and parts of South-East Asia are home to the worldâ€™s only gliding marsupials. The smallest glider species, the feathertail glider (<em>Acrobates pygmaeus</em>), and the largest, the southern and central greater glider (<em>Petauroides volans</em>), both rely on the eucalypt forests and woodlands of eastern Australia.</p>

<p>Vegetation clearing, along with climate change-induced increases in bushfires, has driven declines in all glider species. However, greater gliders and yellow-bellied gliders have suffered the most. Both are now threatened under Commonwealth and Queensland legislation.</p>

<p>The goal of the QGN is to raise awareness of gliders and their habitat requirements across Queensland. We aim to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Promote glider-friendly landscape management</li>
    <li>Enhance habitat within remnant glider populations</li>
    <li>Implement monitoring programs for local glider populations</li>
    <li>Work with governments to implement conservation projects</li>
    <li>Educate communities via workshops, webinars, and spotlighting events</li>
    <li>Partner with landcare and rehabilitation groups</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gliders of Australia</h3>
<p>Australia is home to around 10 glider species!</p>
